# Problem Description
Learning new vocabulary in a foreign language can be challenging, especially when it comes to associating words with real-world contexts, remembering correct spelling, and mastering pronunciation. Traditional flashcards often lack the interactive elements that aid in long-term retention and contextual understanding. Language learners need a tool that offers diverse modes of practice and allows them to customize their learning experience by choosing relevant images and examples.

# Project Idea
This application aims to create an interactive, user-friendly tool that helps users learn foreign words through customizable flashcards. The app allows users to upload word lists (from an Excel file, for example) with translations, fetches relevant images and usage examples from the web, and presents words with multiple learning modes. Users can engage in various activities, such as choosing the correct translation, filling in blank spaces in sentences, and matching pictures with words. They can also personalize the word list by adding, approving, or removing words, images, and sentences.

# Subject of the Exercise Project
The project will be developed as a full-stack application using **Node.js** for backend logic and API integration, **React** for a responsive and interactive user interface, and **MongoDB** for data storage and management. The development process will be tracked and managed with **Jira**, allowing for clear task assignment, sprint planning, and progress monitoring.

This exercise project will focus on building an effective, customizable learning tool that facilitates vocabulary acquisition in an engaging way, providing users with the flexibility to adapt the tool to their personal learning preferences.
